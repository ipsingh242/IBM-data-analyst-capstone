# IBM-data-analyst-capstone
done as guided project of IBM capstone project
I'm currently working on a project that explores stock data analysis and visualization using Python. 
This project aims to provide insights into stock trends and revenue analysis for companies like Tesla and GameStop.
 In this project, I'm leveraging various Python libraries such as yfinance for stock data retrieval, BeautifulSoup for web scraping, and Plotly for interactive data visualization.
 I'm always looking to learn and grow, so feel free to check out my code and provide feedback!
Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
